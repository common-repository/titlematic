Automatically generates a title for posts without a title.

== Description ==

This plugin automatically creates a title for posts that do not have one. If the post contains text, the title is set to the first few characters of the post. For posts without any text content, the title is set to a configurable untitled post string.

== Installation ==

Upload the plugin to your plugins directory and activate it.

By default the plugin uses the first 25 characters of post text and an ellipsis character (3 dots), or the words "Untitled Post" to construct the title. These three options can be configured on the settings page.

== Credits ==

This plugin is based on ideas from the Prologue theme and Luke's Default Post Title plugin.
